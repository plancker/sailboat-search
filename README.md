# sailboat-search
Get search results from history and archive when you Google or DuckDuckGo.
Perfect for people who love DuckDuckGo (or Google) but want more personalised results while maintaining privacy.

Sailboat Search makes it easy for you to re-find things: be it a mail on Gmail, an article, a previously seen product, or a local file. Simply DuckDuckGo/Google as usual and you will see results from your browsing history alongside. 

PRIVACY: Sailboat Search works completely locally (No data is sent to me/google or anyone else) 

Features:
✓ See results from Browser History when you Google/DuckDuckGo
✓ Completely Local (No data is sent to me/google or anyone else)
✓ Archive Pages that you consider important (Just click the extension button)
✓ Get full text search on these Archived Pages when you Google
✓ Option to Automatically archive pages, on which you spend considerable time.

For help after downloading the extension, just right click and go to options.

Sailboat Search has been possible because of Sailboat (a chrome extension that compartmentalizes your browsing history and does much more). Sailboat is available in its dev version on the chrome web store.
